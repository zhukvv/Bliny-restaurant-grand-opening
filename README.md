# Bliny-restaurant-grand-opening
My second Changellenge course project. 

The task was to define a list of cities to open a bliny fast-food restaurant(s) in. 
The list of fast food restaurants and their locations, cities' unit economies, and other external factors were analyzed. 

If you want to directly proceed to the final results of the research, you should read the final presentation [CL-DA-Project2-2.pptx](https://github.com/zhukvv/Bliny-restaurant-grand-opening/blob/main/CL-DA-Project2-2.pptx). 

If you'd like to delve into the details of the analysis, you should 

go through the Jupiter notebook [CL-DA-Project2-2.ipynb](https://github.com/zhukvv/Bliny-restaurant-grand-opening/blob/main/CL-DA-Project2-2.ipynb) and touch upon the unit-economy measures [CL-DA-Project2-2_economy.xlsx](https://github.com/zhukvv/Bliny-restaurant-grand-opening/blob/main/CL-DA-Project2-2_economy.xlsx).
